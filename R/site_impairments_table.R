#' Create a table of site impairments
#'
#' Given quality-controlled data for a given water year, this function
#' identifies which sites are impaired and the dates of their exceedances.
#' A creek/site is impaired if its temperatures exceed water quality standards
#' (WQS) at least twice during the water year and there is a period of at least
#' seven days between two of those exceedances.

#' | Site    | Impaired | Dates of impairment |
#' | ------- | -------- | ------------------- |
#' | Site 1  |  No      |                     |
