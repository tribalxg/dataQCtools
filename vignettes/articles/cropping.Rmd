## Editable script

<!-- this script crops raw data from HOBO files -->

<!-- input: raw data files (csv format), ldrtimes file (Excel format) -->
<!-- output: cropped data files (csv format), plots of cropped data -->

<!-- Important: -->
<!--   Before running this script, rename raw HOBO files to have filenames in -->
<!--     this format: sitename_medium_deployseason_deployyear.csv -->
<!--     e.g. NolanLower_air_sum_23.csv -->

<!--   Make sure ldrtimes has columns for deployment season and year: -->
<!--   ldrtimes$deploy_season = "sum" -->
<!--   ldrtimes$deploy_year = "23" -->

<!-- we can label the red lines on the plots if you like -->

<!-- before running this script, update the file paths below -->
<!-- - to toggle a line between commented (#...) and uncommented (...), use -->
<!--   Shift-Control-C (Windows) or Shift-Command-C (Mac) -->
<!-- - make sure to add a slash "/" at the end of each file path! -->

<!-- if you'd like to have your computer make sound when the job is done, -->
<!-- install and load this package -->
<!-- install.packages("beepr") # uncomment and run this step only once, then comment it again -->
<!-- library(beepr) # leave this uncommented -->
<!-- beep(8) # uncomment if you want to use beepr! -->
<!-- system("say 'Attention all your data has been cropped'") # or on a Mac you can use this -->

<!-- base path: this is the shared part of the filepath to the directories -->
<!-- containing your raw data files, cropped data files, and cropped data plots -->
<!-- - if these folders are in the dataQCtools R project folder, you can use a relative path -->
<!-- - otherwise you can make this an absolute path -->
<!-- - you can also delete base_loc and paste0(base_loc, ...) and just explicitly -->
<!--   specify rawdata_loc, cropped_loc, and croppedplots_loc (see make_qc_plots.R -->
<!--   for an example of this) -->
<!-- - make sure filepaths for folders always end in "/"! -->

Here is a script you can use if you would prefer to have all the cropping code in a single script rather than an installable package format. Just click the clipboard icon in the top right corner of this code chunk to copy the code, then open a new R script in RStudio and paste it there, and save the script wherever you would like to store it on your computer.
