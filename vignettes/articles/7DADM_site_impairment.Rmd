## Editable script

Here is a script you can use if you would prefer to have all the code for the 7DADM and site impairment steps in a single script rather than an installable package format. Just click the clipboard icon in the top right corner of this code chunk to copy the code, then open a new R script in RStudio and paste it there, and save the script wherever you would like to store it on your computer.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

```


## Demo using `dataQCtools`

```{r setup}
library(dataQCtools)
```
